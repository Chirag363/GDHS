# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements voice-to-text input and text-to-speech output functionality in the chat section of the application. Users will be able to speak their messages instead of typing, and receive audio responses from the AI assistant using ElevenLabs API for high-quality speech synthesis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to speak my messages to the chat instead of typing, so that I can interact more naturally and efficiently with the AI assistant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks a voice input button THEN the system SHALL start recording audio from the microphone
2. WHEN the user stops recording THEN the system SHALL convert the audio to text using speech recognition
3. WHEN the audio is successfully converted THEN the system SHALL display the transcribed text in the chat input field
4. IF the speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow the user to try again
5. WHEN the transcribed text is available THEN the system SHALL allow the user to edit it before sending

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to hear the AI assistant's responses as speech, so that I can receive information without having to read text on screen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI assistant provides a text response THEN the system SHALL convert the text to speech using ElevenLabs API
2. WHEN the text-to-speech conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL automatically play the audio response
3. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL provide controls to pause, stop, or replay the audio
4. IF the text-to-speech conversion fails THEN the system SHALL display the text response normally without audio
5. WHEN multiple responses are queued THEN the system SHALL play them in sequence without overlap
